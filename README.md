The first project from [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v).

## Overview

This is a simple counter app built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS. It mainly focus on making functions, calling an event when the user clicks the buttons and displaying text content.
Apart from the proposed, I added a 'water log' theme to the project, with custom colors and fonts.  I also added decrement and reset buttons, and changed 'onclick' on HTML to addEventListener on the js file.
